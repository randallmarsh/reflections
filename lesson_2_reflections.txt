What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a hidden directory in which it tracks changes to the repository.
Wouldn't track otherwise. Need to be explicit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a cached area that allows parts of the solution to be tied together by a commit.
The working directory is just a file system and the repository is that working directory plus git information.
