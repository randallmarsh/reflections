How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a cached area that allows parts of the solution to be tied together by a commit.
The working directory is just a file system and the repository is that working directory plus git information.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only what you need. If logical changes spanned two files, then you can add the two at once.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

It helps to trace back the parent path and which commits are in each branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merge combines two branches into a new master branch. Diagramatically, we show the two paths coming together so that the new bath shows the branches as parent commits.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Con's are it really isn't automatic. Changes still need to be tracked. However, if well annotated, this is not a problem.
